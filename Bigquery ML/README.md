## Online Prediction with BigQuery ML

Learn how to train and deploy a churn prediction model for real-time inference using BigQuery and BigQuery ML. This tutorial covers the process of querying public data in BigQuery using Python and SQL, preparing the data for modeling, training a classification model with BigQuery ML, registering the model to Vertex AI Model Registry, and deploying it to an endpoint on Vertex AI for online predictions.

The steps performed in this tutorial include:

- Querying public data in BigQuery using Python & SQL
- Preparing the data for modeling
- Training a classification model with BigQuery ML
- Registering and inspecting the model on Vertex AI Model Registry
- Deploying the model to an endpoint on Vertex AI
- Making sample online predictions using the model endpoint

## Get Started with BigQuery ML Training

Learn how to use BigQuery ML for training with Vertex AI. This tutorial guides you through the process of creating a local BigQuery table in your project, training a BigQuery ML model, evaluating the model, exporting it as a cloud model, uploading the exported model as a Vertex AI Model resource, hyperparameter tuning with Vertex AI Vizier, and automatically registering the BigQuery ML model to Vertex AI Model Registry.

The steps performed in this tutorial include:

- Creating a local BigQuery table in your project
- Training a BigQuery ML model
- Evaluating the BigQuery ML model
- Exporting the BigQuery ML model as a cloud model
- Uploading the exported model as a Vertex AI Model resource
- Hyperparameter tuning a BigQuery ML model with Vertex AI Vizier
